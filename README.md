## 📌 Project Overview

This project proposes a brain function mapping prediction system based on generative artificial intelligence, aiming to address the difficulty in acquiring task-based fMRI data for **Alzheimer's Disease (AD) patients**. By constructing a **ViT-GAN hybrid model**, the system can generate high-quality task-based cognitive activation maps from resting-state fMRI data, covering multiple cognitive domains such as memory, language, attention, and executive function, providing imaging support for individualized Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) target localization.

## 🎯 Core Objectives

- ✅ **Build resting-state → task-state mapping model**: Generate task-based cognitive activation maps from resting-state fMRI
- ✅ **Multi-cognitive domain independent modeling**: Support generation of maps for 7 cognitive domains (memory, language, attention, executive function, emotion regulation, visuospatial ability, social cognition)
- ✅ **Individualized modeling without healthy controls**: Use only AD patient data for training and prediction
- ✅ **Multi-dimensional evaluation system**: Combine SSIM, PSNR, G-Loss and other metrics for generation quality assessment

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Alzheimer's Disease Chinese Population Multimodal MRI Database (Science Data Bank)
- **Samples**: Paired resting-state and task-based fMRI data from 146 AD patients
- **Preprocessing Pipeline**:
  - Realignment → Coregistration → Normalization → Smoothing → Filtering → Second-level Analysis
  - Processed using SPM12 toolbox, output in standard NIfTI format

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

### Overall Workflow

### Generator: Residual_mid_UNet3D_vit
Combines 3D UNet with Vision Transformer to enhance global modeling capability.

### Discriminator: 3D PatchGAN
Performs local authenticity discrimination on generated images to improve detail quality.

### Loss Functions
Multi-scale loss function design:
- **L1 Reconstruction Loss**: Pixel-level structural alignment
- **Perceptual Loss**: High-level semantic feature consistency
- **Adversarial Loss**: Local detail authenticity optimization

### Phase-wise Training Strategy
- **Warm-up Stage (first 10 epochs)**: Only L1 and perceptual losses
- **Adversarial Stage (epochs 11-200)**: Add adversarial loss for detail refinement
